# Kronforst-Scale-Project

## Project Description

Created an Optimized PCA to select features influencing scale color across 8 different families of butterflies and moths including CRISPR-Cas9 mutant variants.

## Aims 

1. Understand which ultra-structure characteristics contribute to scale color most prominently in 6 different families across the Lepidoptera and 2-month families family by family.

2. Understand which ultra-sctructure characteristics are effected most by a mutation that leads to a color change in the Butterfly's scales.
