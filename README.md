# Kronforst-Scale-Project

## Project Description
Created an Optimized PCA to select features influencing scale color across 8 different families of butterflies and moths including CRISPR-Cas9 mutant variants.

## Aims
1. Understand which ultra-structure characteristics contribute to scale color most prominently in 6 different families across the Lepidoptera and 2-month families family by family.

2. Understand which ultra-sctructure characteristics are effected most by a mutation that leads to a color change in the Butterfly's scales.  

## Methods

### Ultra-structure characteristics taken from publications

### RGB values

### Color Classification 

### PCA for reducing the dimentionality of our data

### Feature Selection by Optimizing a PCA for fewer components

## Analysis 

### All Data

### Dark vs. Light Scales

### Family Analysis

### Mutant Analysis
